# Chapter-8: Creating an Appâ€™s Navigation
### What I learned
I learned how to implement navigation in Flutter using the Navigator class and routes to manage transitions between screens. This included working with named routes for cleaner and more maintainable navigation, as well as anonymous routes for simpler cases. I also explored passing data between screens and handling navigation stacks effectively to enhance user flow within an app.

### Achievement
I successfully built a multi-page app with seamless navigation, utilizing both named and anonymous routes to create an intuitive user experience.
